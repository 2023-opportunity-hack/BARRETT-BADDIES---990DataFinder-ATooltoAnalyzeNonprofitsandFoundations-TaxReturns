# 9-90 Scraper 
Inspration!
- Legends Animated is a non-profit organization with a mission of promoting “the awareness and appreciation of animation as a medium for all forms of storytelling.”
-Inspired by the guerrilla filmmaking movement, Legends Animated truly helps provide underrepresented, independent animators with a platform to share and develop their stories.
- Being able to search and sort specific data from the tax return forms of nonprofits around the nation would help them find the right financial partners, ensuring that their apprentices and employees are always fairly compensated for their efforts.
- Nine-90 allows the user to search through data from 990 tax returns of nonprofits around the nation with different search options including geographic location, grant application process, the grant application recipient, submission deadlines, restrictions and limitations, and whether or not the foundation accepts unsolicited requests for funds. Apart from this, Nine-90 can also search through data on nonprofit salaries with search options of geographic locations, annual gross revenue, annual net revenue, and employee title, such as those including keywords like director and chief, making it easier for Legends Animated to succeed. 

# What tools were used?
- Our program was built through three stages: scraping the information from the 990 tax return forms, applying Elasticsearch using Svelte as our framework, and designing the front-end code for the user interface. The program also uses Leaflet to implement the geographical location requirements of the problem.
